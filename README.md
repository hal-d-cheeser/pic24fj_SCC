# Solar MPPT Battery Charger

PIC24FJ MPPT Battery Charger

This project uses a PIC24FJ64GA002 for a solar charge controller

It is used to control a 2 stage converter

There are 2 options for algorithms to use, Incremental Conductance and Perturb and observe

The second stage DC-DC converter is a battery charger

In this code, there is a lot of room for improvement
